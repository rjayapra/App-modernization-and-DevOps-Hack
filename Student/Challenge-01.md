# Challenge 01: Azure App Service Bicep Template

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction
In this challenge, you will create an Azure App Service Bicep template. Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications. Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources.

## Objective
Your objective is to create a Bicep template that deploys an Azure App Service and a web application to Azure.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this challenge, you should have a Bicep template that can be used to deploy a web application to Azure App Service.

## Requirements
- You must use Bicep to define the Azure resources.
- The Bicep template should include an Azure App Service and any necessary dependencies.
- You can choose any programming language for the web application.

## Instructions
Follow these steps to complete the challenge:

1. Create a new Bicep file.
2. Define the necessary Azure resources in the Bicep file, including the App Service and any required dependencies.
3. Configure the App Service with the desired settings, such as the runtime stack and deployment options.
4. Define the web application code and any additional resources required by the application.
5. Test the Bicep template locally using the Bicep CLI.
6. Deploy the Bicep template to Azure using the Azure CLI or Azure Portal.
7. Verify that the web application is successfully deployed and accessible.

## Additional Resources

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness and completeness of the Bicep template.
- Successful deployment of the web application to Azure.
- Quality and organization of the code.
- Documentation and clarity of the submission.

## Submission
To submit your completed Bicep template, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your submission.
3. Commit and push your Bicep template to the branch.
4. Create a pull request to submit your solution.
